# Explorer for the [Cord19 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge)

The Cord19-Explorer is a tool developed within [ESAT-PSI](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi) at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/) meant to help machine learning researchers, medical experts as well as the general audience to explore the data from the [Covid19 dataset by AllenAI](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge). An explanation of the explorer functionality is included in the [NLP COVID-19 Workshop](https://www.nlpcovid19workshop.org/) submission. Finally, we open-source the codebase behind the explorer, the codebase used to develop and train the deep learning models, and the codebase for the Cord19-Visualizer (explained in the NLP COVID-19 Workshop submission).
